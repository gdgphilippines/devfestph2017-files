# 1. Overview

Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a way to build pages for static content that render fast. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are reliable, fast and engaging experiences on the web. There are several ways in which a developer can use AMP components to build a PWA experience in their website.

This lab walks you through implementing two different AMP + PWA patterns: 1) transforming an AMP site into a PWA, and 2) enhancing it using the App Shell architecture.

## What you'll learn

✔️ How to transform an AMP canonical site into a PWA

✔️ How to enhance the experience using the AMP pages as a base for an app shell

## What you should already know

- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- How to run commands from the command line
- Some familiarity with service workers is recommended
- Some familiarity with [AMP](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/accelerated-mobile-pages-foundations/#0) structure and restrictions is recommended

## What you will need

- A recent version of Chrome
- A browser that [doesn't support service worker](https://jakearchibald.github.io/isserviceworkerready/#service-worker-enthusiasm) (to test fallback code)
- Node.js and npm
