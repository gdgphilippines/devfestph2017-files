# 4. Save and Do a test run

Save the scene with the name "ARScene" and add it to the list of scenes when building. Now is a good time to run the sample. If everything is working, you should be prompted for permission to take pictures and record video, then show you the preview of the camera image. If it does it means you are ready to use ARCore!

If there is an error, you'll want to resolve it before continuing with the codelab.
