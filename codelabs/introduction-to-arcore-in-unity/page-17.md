# 17. Congratulations! You made it!

Well done working through this codelab! A quick re-cap of what was covered:

*   Enabling ARCore through the Player settings
*   Adding the ARCore SDK prefabs to the scene
*   Scaling objects consistently to look reasonable with respect to the real world.
*   Using Anchors to place objects at a fixed location relative to the real world.
*   Using detected planes as the foundation of augmented reality objects
*   Using touch and gaze input to interact with the ARCore scene
