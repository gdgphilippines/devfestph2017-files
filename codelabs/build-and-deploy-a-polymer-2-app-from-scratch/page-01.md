# 1. Introduction

Polymer is a library that helps you create custom HTML elements. In this codelab, you'll build a web app with custom elements.

## What you will build
  
   In this codelab, you're going to build a simple game in the form of a Web app. The app will:
     
   * Present a flag to the user
   * Invite the user to guess which country the flag belongs to
   * Tell the user whether they got the answer correct or incorrect
   * Let the user click a button to show them another flag to identify

## What you'll learn
  
  ✔ How to set up your own development environment to work with Polymer
  
  ✔ How to generate an app from a Polymer template

  ✔ How to add pre-built Web Components to your app

  ✔ How to add pre-built Web Components to your app

  ✔ How to use Polymer elements and features to load files, manipulate data, and respond to user interaction

## What you'll need

To start the tutorial, you will need some software:

* A command line, like xterm or bash
* A text editor (preferably one that does code highlighting, like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) )
* The [latest version of chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjw5uTMBRAYEiwA5HxQNmns445SiDx2dJrTUfWgKBYE2fBeOAZOzzvzLb_cSrJJE-4EDQ2JOhoCc_YQAvD_BwE&dclid=CP-vsbyZ5tUCFVK_GAodPekEAw)

You'll also need to have some basic skills and knowledge:

* Using a command line
* Basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, functions, conditionals, and loops
* Basic understanding of object-oriented programming concepts such as objects, classes, abstraction, and encapsulation

That said, I assume you know about as much about web development as I do (very little!). This tutorial is for beginners.
