# 8. Next steps

Congratulations, you've taken your first steps into a larger world of deep learning!

You can see more about using TensorFlow at the [TensorFlow website](http://tensorflow.org) or the TensorFlow [Github project](https://github.com/tensorflow/). There are lots of other resources available for TensorFlow, including a [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/a/tensorflow.org/forum/#!forum/discuss) and [whitepaper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45166.pdf).

If you make a trained model that you want to run in production, you should also check out [TensorFlow Serving](https://tensorflow.github.io/serving/), an open source project that makes it easier to manage TensorFlow projects.

If you're interested in running TensorFlow on mobile devices try [the second part of this tutorial](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2) which will show you how to optimize your model to run on Android.

Or just go have some fun in the [TensorFlow Playground](http://playground.tensorflow.org)!

_This codelab is based on Pete Warden's_ [_TensorFlow for Poets_](https://petewarden.com/2016/02/28/tensorflow-for-poets/) _blog post and this_ [_retraining tutorial_](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining)_._
