# 3. Open the project and run the app

First, let's look at the starter app in Android Studio.

Start Android Studio and open the **vr_view_app_101** project, by selecting "**Import project**" from the Welcome screen, or from the menu by **File > New > Import** project.... Select the `build.gradle` file and press OK.

> **Note**: If you get a notice about "Unregistered VCS root detected", you can click "Ignore".

Next, we need to build the project manually the first time. After this first build changes will be automatically detected by Android Studio. To Build, select **Build > Make Project.**

To run the application, press the **Run** button on the toolbar. This will present a dialog to select the deployment target. If no devices are connected, connect a device or start an emulator to run. When the application launches you will see:

The sample application is a simple tab layout with 2 fragments. Next, let's take a panoramic picture and add it to the project.
