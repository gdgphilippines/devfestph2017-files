# 2. Getting Started

For this codelab, we'll start with an application that has 2 fragments. One is about Google I/O 2016 codelabs. The other fragment is like an encyclopedia page. We'll replace some of the included images with VR View elements that will give the 360 degree view, and an immersive experience via Cardboard.

### Get the sample project

For this codelab, we've made an Android application as a starting point. During this codelab, we'll walk through how easy it is to add VR View.
