# 9. Save and Run the application

Save all the files and press Run. The application should start on the welcome tab, and you can look around in the VrPanoramaView that was added about codelabs. Swipe left (or tap About Gorillas) to see the video.

Congratulations! You can now add VR view to all of your applications to provide a more rich and immersive experience.

> **Did the app not run as expected?** One thing to try is to rebuild the application by selecting Build/Rebuild Project from the menu.
