# 1. Introduction

<img src="https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/mdc-android/img/8c0dd3b666dcdb8.png" alt="MDC Logo" width="50">  Material Components (MDC) helps developers execute Material Design. Developed by a core team of engineers and UX designers at Google, MDC includes the same visual components Google uses in its apps. MDC has over 10 beautiful and functional Android components and is available also for iOS and Web.

***

This codelab will show you some situations where MDC can make your app more functional and more beautiful while saving you engineering time.

### What you will build

In this codelab, you're going to complete Shrine, an ecommerce app that sells clothing, home goods, and popsicles. Your app will:


- Have an animated, stretchable app bar.
- Allow users to navigate between categories using the bottom navigation pattern
- Have a grid layout with adjusted density based on screen size

### Components to use
- Toolbar, AppBarLayout, and CollapsingToolbarLayout
- BottomNavigationView
- RecyclerView and GridLayoutManager

### What you'll need
- Android Studio 2.3+
- [The sample code](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/archive/master.zip) (note: the sample code is located in the `demos/codelabs/building-beautiful-apps` subdirectory)
- Basic Android programming and Java


This codelab is focused on using Material Components. There are mentions of non-relevant concepts and code blocks for you to simply copy and paste.
