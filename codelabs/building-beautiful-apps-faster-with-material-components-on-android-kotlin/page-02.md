> The starter app is located within the `/starter` directory. To keep things simple, be sure **not** to import the top-level directory (`mdc-android-kotlin`).

### Run the starter app
1. Make sure the configuration to the left of the Run / Play button is â€˜app'.
2. Press the Run / Play button.
3. Select a device in the deployment target dialog.
4. Click OK
5. Android Studio builds the app, deploys it, and automatically opens it on the target device.
