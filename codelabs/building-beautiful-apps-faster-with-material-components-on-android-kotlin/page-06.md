# 6. Wrapping up

We started with a basic ecommerce application, but gave it new life with Material Components for Android. Now there is a large, immersive app bar with eye-catching content that moves away when the user scrolls down to look at the content. The bottom navigation is easy to reach and makes it simple to navigate around the app. The grid adjusts its content density across various screen sizes. You and your designer can rest easy knowing your app is using components that are well tested and follow the Material Design guidelines.   

> A final version of the app is available within the `/completed` directory. Feel free to test your version of the app against the completed app in the directory.   


### Where to go from here
This simple example demonstrates a few important components, but Material Components for Android has more to offer. Take a look at the Material Design [GitHub repository](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android), which contains all of the code that makes up the library, as well as [documentation](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/docs) for the components, and [applications](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/tree/master/demos/java/io/material/demo/shrine) that demonstrate a wider variety of components and usage. Thank you for giving Material Components for Android a try, and we hoped you enjoyed this codelab!
