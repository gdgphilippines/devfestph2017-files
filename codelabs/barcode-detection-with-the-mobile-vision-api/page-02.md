# 2. Creating an App That Supports Barcodes

In this step you'll create the basic skeleton of an app that you'll fill in later by adding the sign in code.

### Create the new App

Open **Android Studio**. When you launch Android Studio, you'll see an option to ‘Start a new Android Studio project'. Select this. You'll see the ‘New Project' dialog. Enter the details for your app.

Press Next, and you'll get a screen asking to ‘Target Android Devices'. Accept the default here, and press Next to the next screen.

You'll see ‘Add an activity to Mobile' dialog. **Ensure that you select ‘Blank Activity' here.**
