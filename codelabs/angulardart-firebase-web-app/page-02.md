# 2. Set up

In this step, you download the software that you need.

## Get Dart and Dartium

▶️  If you haven't already done so, get the [Dart SDK](https://www.dartlang.org/install) version **1.24** and [Dartium](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/dartium/#getting-dartium).

▶️  Note where you installed the SDK and Dartium. You'll need these paths when you configure WebStorm.

> The **Dart SDK** download includes several Dart tools that you'll need. If you want to run them from the command line, add `<path-to-the-SDK>/dart-sdk/bin` to your path.  

> **Dartium** is the easiest way to test your app during development.

## Get WebStorm, IntelliJ IDEA, or a plugin

▶️  If you don't have a favorite editor already, [install and configure WebStorm](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/webstorm). Alternatively, download one of the [Dart plugins for other IDEs and editors](https://www.dartlang.org/tools).
