### [**`TRY IT`**](https://janamou.github.io/firebase-counter/)

If you know how to program, you can complete this codelab. You **don't** need previous experience with Dart or with web programming.

## What are Dart, AngularDart, and Firebase?

**Dart** is an open source programming language that you can use for web and mobile applications development. **AngularDart** is a framework that you can use for building full-featured web applications with Dart. AngularDart is used heavily by Google—for example, in AdWords and AdSense. **Firebase** is a service that provides a backend that you can use without writing server-side code.

## What you'll build

You'll use AngularDart and a Firebase library to build a shared, real-time counter.

## What you'll learn

✔ How to create a basic AngularDart app using a template.

✔ How to load and save data using the Firebase Realtime Database.

✔ How to work with Firebase transactions.

✔ How to use AngularDart material components.

This codelab uses—but doesn't try to teach you about—HTML, CSS, Angular syntax, the Dart language, and common Dart APIs. You can learn more about these glossed-over topics by following the links sprinkled around the following pages.

## What you'll use

This codelab requires version **1.24** of the **Dart SDK**. The instructions feature **Dartium** and the **WebStorm IDE**, but if you have some experience with Dart, you can use whichever tools you prefer.
