# 1. Overview

This codelab will teach you how to embed 360 degree VR media into websites using [VR View](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/vrview). This technology is designed for developers of traditional apps to enhance them with immersive content. For example, VR view makes it easy for a travel app to provide viewers with an underwater scuba diving tour as they plan vacation or for a home builder to take prospective buyers on virtual walkthrough before the home is built.

VR View is available not only on web pages, but also for Android and iOS. There is a companion codelab to this one which introduces VR view in Android.

### What you'll learn

*   How to embed a 360 degree photosphere in a web page.
*   What format images and videos are supported and how to make a sample image.

### What you'll need

*   A modern version of a web browser such as Chrome, Safari, Firefox or IE11.
*   An Android Device running Android 4.4+ (KitKat) or greater.
*   Your favorite HTML editor.
*   The [VR view for the web source code](https://github.com/google/vrview).
*   [Chrome based web server](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en) - for testing web pages which include VR view.
*   The [Cardboard Camera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.cyclops) app on your device.
*   Optionally, the Cardboard app on your device, and a Cardboard viewer.
*   A USB cable to connect the device to the computer.

During the codelab we'll download code from Github:

*   The [codelab starter project](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/vr_view_101).
*   The [VR view for the web source code](https://github.com/google/vrview).
