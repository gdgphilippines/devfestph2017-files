# 8. View the website in Cardboard

Now that we have updated the website to use VR view, we can enjoy a more rich experience in the web browser. But wait, there's more! Since we used stereo images and video, we can have a really immersive view when using Cardboard!

1.  Open the website on your computer in the browser on the phone.
2.  Pick one of the VR view and tap the cardboard logo at the bottom.
3.  Slide the phone into Cardboard and look around at the picture you took!

Now, click on the link to the gorilla page, and view the video in Cardboard using the same approach!
