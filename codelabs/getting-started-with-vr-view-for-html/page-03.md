# 3. View the website

First, let's take a look at a web page about I/O. This is included in the sample code. `website/` directory. You'll need to run a web server to see the page in action. For the codelab, we'll use a Chrome based web server. To start the web server,

1.  Click on the "Apps" ![Apps Icon](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/vr_view_101/img/cad5a4bf7984ae99.png) bookmark in the bookmark bar
2.  Find "Web Server"![Web Server Icon](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/vr_view_101/img/f8abf9cec8c5625c.png)in the list and click it.
3.  Click "Choose Folder" and select the `vr_view_101/website` directory.
4.  Make sure the web server is started.
5.  Enable "Accessible accessible on local network" so we can see this site on a phone.

6.  Click on the link to the "Web Server URL(s)" to see the site. It should show a directory listing of the files, click on `index.html`

As you can see, we've removed the material design and other styles that make web sites great so we can focus on adding VR view functionality - which we'll do next!
