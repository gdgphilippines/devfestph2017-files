# 4. Add the VR View code

Typically, you'll capture images and video and host it on the web. For trying out VR view and initial testing you can use the URL to the public viewer. However, since there are some situations where this will not work as well as you want, we suggest hosting the VR view code on your own site. All the details on getting the code and why you'd want to host it yourself can be reviewed here: [https://developers.google.com/cardboard/vrview#self_hosting](https://developers.google.com/cardboard/vrview#self_hosting).

Now, let's clone the vrview project into ours. From a command prompt, change directories to `vr_view_101/website,` and clone the vrview project:

`$ git clone https://github.com/google/vrview`

Your directory should now look like this:

Now we have all the code we need, let's get an image.
