TensorFlow is a multipurpose machine learning framework. TensorFlow can be used anywhere from training huge models across clusters in the cloud, to running models locally on an embedded system like your phone.

### What you'll Learn

*   In [TensorFlow for Poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/index.html#0): How to train a custom image recognition model.
*   How to optimize your model.
*   How to compress your model.
*   How to run it in a pre-made Android app.

### What you will build

A simple camera app that runs a TensorFlow image recognition program to identify flowers.
