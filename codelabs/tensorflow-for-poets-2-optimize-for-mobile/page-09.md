There are lots of options:

*   Review other [mobile-tensorflow](http://tensorflow.org/mobile/) examples. The other Android examples include apps that do [image stylization and pedestrian-detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android). The Stylization example is also available [as a codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-style-transfer-android/index.html).
*   If you want to learn more about TensorFlow in general, see [getting started](http://tensorflow.org/get_started).
