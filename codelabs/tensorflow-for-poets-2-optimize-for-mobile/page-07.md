# 7. Run the app

### Set up the Android device

You can't load the app from android studio onto your phone unless you activate "developer mode" and "USB Debugging". This is a one time setup process.

Follow the instructions at [how to geek](https://www.howtogeek.com/129728/how-to-access-the-developer-options-menu-and-enable-usb-debugging-on-android-4.2/).

### Build and install the app

Plug in your phone and hit play, ![](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/img/74540ff4e857014c.png), in Android Studio to start the build and install process.

Next you will need to select your phone from this popup:

Now allow the Tensorflow Demo to access your camera and files:

Now the app is installed, click the app icon, ![TensorFlow](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2/img/657bf64bf2100135.png), to launch it. You can hold the power and volume-down buttons to take a screenshot.

Now try a web search for flowers, point the camera at the computer screen, and see if those pictures are correctly classified.

It should look something like this:
