## 3. Create a Polymer app from a template

1. Create a folder for your app, cd to it, and initialize your Polymer app
```
mkdir whose-flag
cd whose-flag
polymer init
```

2. When prompted to choose the type of project you want to create, select **Polymer 2.0 Application**.

3. Press **Enter** to accept the default application name and main element name supplied by the Polymer CLI:  ```whose-flag``` and  ```whose-flag-app```

4. When prompted for a description of your app, type:  ```Match flags to their countries!```

5. Press Enter. The Polymer CLI creates the scaffolding for your app.

6. Type ``ls`` and have a look at the file structure Polymer CLI has set up for you. You should see something like this:

## What is all this stuff?

The Polymer CLI has generated the files and folders composing the basic structure of an app. Here's a short explanation of these files and folders:

| File or folder | What's inside |
| -------------- | ------------- |
`bower_components` | Your app has a set of _dependencies_ - chunks of code that it depends on to work. These dependencies are managed with Bower, a package manager, and stored in the `bower_components` folder. |
`bower.json` | Describes your app's dependencies to the package manager, Bower. |
`index.html` | Your app's landing page. |
`manifest.json` | Stores metadata for your app that helps browsers to load it efficiently. |
`README.md` | README files usually describe how to install and use the app. Currently, yours contains some default content generated by the Polymer CLI.
`src/` | Folder that stores the code we'll write for your app - html, javascript and css.
`test/` | A placeholder folder for automated tests. You won't need this since you will test your app manually.
----------------

Let's take a look at `src/whose-flag-app/whose-flag-app.html`. Open this file in a text editor.

### whose-flag-app.html

```html
<link rel="import" href="../../bower_components/polymer/polymer-element.html">
 
 <dom-module id="whose-flag-app">
   <template>
     <style>
       :host {
         display: block;
       }
     </style>
     <h2>Hello [[prop1]]!</h2>
   </template>
 
   <script>
     /**
      * @customElement
      * @polymer
      */
     class WhoseFlagApp extends Polymer.Element {
       static get is() { return 'whose-flag-app'; }
       static get properties() {
         return {
           prop1: {
             type: String,
             value: 'whose-flag-app'
           }
         };
       }
     }
 
     window.customElements.define(WhoseFlagApp.is, WhoseFlagApp);
   </script>
 </dom-module>
```

Here are some important things to note:

- The `<template>` block is where we define the visual elements of the page. We will work inside the `<template>` block, adding interface elements to construct the app.
- The `<style>` block defines the look and feel of the interface elements in the `<template>` block. This is where we will put CSS rules that define styles.
- The `<script>` block contains code that defines your app and provides its functionality. This is also where we'll add things like methods that get called when the user clicks a button.
- `prop1` is a property. It is declared in the class definition for `WhoseFlagApp`:

### whose-flag-html
```javascript
static get properties() {
  return {
    prop1: {
      type: String,
        value: 'whose-flag-app'
    }
  };
}
```

This means you can use it in your HTML, like this:

```html
<h2>Hello [[prop1]]!</h2>

```

The square brackets denote a Polymer feature called data binding. We'll learn more about this soon.
